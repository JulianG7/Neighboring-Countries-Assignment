The final assignment to graduate from KTH university 

# Neighboring-Countries-Assignment
Please run the file "Microgrid_BE_NL" in order to successfully run my code.
As a result from thsi code you will get the plots of the two networks independently for each of the countries as Netherlands and Belgium respectively without repeating any code and following all the pep8.
Unluckily even if I found the 5 IDs that are common inthe files of both countries I couldnÂ´t find the way to merge both of them. I trie ddifferent methods and I was always getting some errors. But at least now finally I can say I understood well how to work with the xml files and how to build my own network or by parsing them.
Finally the video where I explain the code I have built for this assignment can be seen in youtube by watching it through this link.
