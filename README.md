The final assignment to graduate from KTH university 

# Neighboring-Countries-Assignment
Please run the file "Microgrid_be_nl_merged" in order to successfully run my code.
As a result from this code you will get the plots of the two networks independently for each of the countries as Netherlands and Belgium respectively without repeating any code and following all the pep8. But as well, after merging the two dictionaries of each country into dic_merged, you will also be able to display the merged grid of the neighbouring countries.

I found the 5 IDs that are common in the files of both countries . I tried different methods of how to merge the two grids and I think I finally succeeded. Therefore, now finally I can say I understood well how to work with the xml files and how to build my own network or by parsing them.
Finally the video where I explain the code I have built for this assignment can be seen in youtube by watching it through this link, being this the explanation for the "Microgrid_BE_NL" file which is the one where I couldn't merge the grids but with the new ones yes.
